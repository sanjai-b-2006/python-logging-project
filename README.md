# python-logging-project
This project showcases the use of Python's built-in logging module to efficiently track events, errors, and operational information. The app.py script demonstrates how to configure logging, set various log levels, and implement logging best practices in Python applications.

The logging configuration in app.py is designed to capture debug and higher-level messages. Log messages are formatted to include the timestamp, logger name, log level, and message content. The logs are directed to both a file (app.log) and the console for easy monitoring, ensuring that critical information is always accessible.

The script includes several arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and root. Each function logs its operation, providing clear insights into the computation process. For instance, the add function logs the sum of two numbers, while the divide function logs the result of division and manages potential division by zero errors by logging an appropriate error message.
